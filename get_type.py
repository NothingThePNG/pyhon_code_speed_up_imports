  '''
  This is a funtion to get integers with a output, and a optional number.
  This fition will contiueasly loop asking the user for an input in till it gets a number
  then it will return the input as an ingiger 
  you can also set a range being 2 numbers in a list that the input must be in 
    Note: the lowist number of the range is a valid number and the highest is not 
      Meaning a range of [1,5] 1 is a valid number but 5 is not

  output: str
    the output that will be printed when the user gets an invalid input
  num: str
    a number that will be cheeked so you can iput a string that will be cheeked
  first_out: str
    the first output that will be printed when the user gets an invalid input if not changed it will only use output
  vaid_range: list
    a list of 2 numbers that the input must be in the rules of wich are difined above if not changed or and invalid range like [1,3,5] or "1, 5" there will be no range
  range_out: str
    the output that will be printed when the user gets an valid input that is not in the range if not changed it will be 'Not in range: '

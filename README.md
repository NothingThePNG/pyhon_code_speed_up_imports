# pyhon_code_speed_up_imports


## python imorts to help with adding basic funtionlilty faster or better outputs

## for get type there are severl diffrint kinds of inputs 

these funtions will take a input and will contiuely ask for a input in till it's in the type wanted

all funtions have output variabel wich contrls what the user will be asked

there is get_init only returning ints
there is get_float only returning floats

these funtions also have a vaid_rang wich will make it so it will only retun a value in a renge set by a list eg. vaid_rang=[1, 10] only gives nubers betwen 1 and 10 

there is also sting inputs wich have want_lower wich make's inputs lower case so it's not case sesive 
defalt is Ture so you will need to set your valid inputs to pure lower case or chang it to False

fist of the sting inputs get_val_str with hase a value acceptable wich is a list of inputs. when one is inputed it's retured
the defalt for acceptable is ["y", "n"]

last there is get_accept with to types of conform and deny both are list if a input is given from the conform list ture is retund else if a input form deny is given flase is retuned 

## for g_print there is: 
g_print_str for printing letters one letter at a time

g_print_lis pint with out modification will print

all tho the sorting is case seitive so if there are capital letters in the dictionary the capitals will come first and I don't know how to fix
